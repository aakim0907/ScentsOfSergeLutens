Inspired by their unique and deep fragrances, this project will visualize the scents of Serge Lutens using D3.js and Node.js. 

### Minimum Viable Product (MVP)

- [ ] Scrape note information using Node.js
- [ ] Visualize and connect nodes of fragrance notes using D3.js
- [ ] Implement on-hover & on-click event handlers on data visualization
- [ ] Implement filters for different types (Ambery / Gourmands / Mohair / Floral / Woody) and display prevalent notes
- [ ] Display a shelf of Serge Luten main-line perfumes (interactive with data visualization)
- [ ] A production Readme
